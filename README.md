# gdNetTest

gdNetTest is a simple game demo with proper multiplayer networking:
  - Authoritative server: no easy cheating!
  - Client-side prediction: instant response to user input
  - Server reconciliation: seamless correction when stuff doesn't match up
  - Snapshot interpolation: other players show smooth movement
  - (TODO) Lag compensation: users don't notice any server delays
  - (TODO) Bandwidth optimization: lower network usage

The demo's code isn't uploaded yet, but I needed a place to host the server files so my Linode server can pull them during setup.
